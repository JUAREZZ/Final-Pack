#opened and closed Github issues

#I had 14 open issues on one of my github repository. I managed to close about 9 of them since more

than one was about mispelling. I also helped other teammates make some corections to their repository. 

#thanks to taimaishuze, loknjinu13, and paveldanek for helping me make corrections and to review my repository.
