LINUX CLASS 

# WEEKLY LABS

Weekly labs were turn in on time, i did have some trouble trying to turn some in, but most were turned in. 
some of the shell script were challanging but i managed to figure them out.

# Fianl project 

On our final project we had some issues with out first attempt, which was WIKINETS my team mates took most of the time trying to
figure it out why it wouldn't work, just to find out some PHP was not compatiable with apache. so we moved to MOINMOIN, the same thing happen here. which was that our project MOINMOIN wasen't compatible with APACHE server.so finally we had a week to figure out what we were going to do, until we were given a idea of postfix a mail server. It worked out well with the documentation and doing some testing to make sure it works.

# I enjoyed taking this class, a bit challanging but overall it was a great course.
