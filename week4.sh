# The following creates a folder in /Desktop.
# It then places a txt file with the contents of /dev into that new folder.
# It then opens the txt file in Nano.

cd /home/user/Desktop

mkdir ./week2

cd /dev

ls > /home/user/Desktop/week2/DevContents.txt

#radley script was kind of simple to follow, It was well presented. I tried doing it differently and I had some trouble
but I made it happened.  I made a different one underneath not the same but that’s what I came up with.

#!/bin/bash
#this script will create a file, a directory and moving the file in to directory
#creates a file

touch test1

#checks if the file was created

ls -F

#back to home directory

cd

#creates a directory

mkdir wk2

#moves test1 into wk2 directory

mv  test1/home/user/wk2
